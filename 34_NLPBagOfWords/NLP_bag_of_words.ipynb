get some carbs in your stomach.', 'Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.', \"If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?\", 'She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.', \"After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat
